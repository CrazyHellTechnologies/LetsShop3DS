# Let's Shop has been closed; thank you for using the service.
# Do not follow these instructions, the server has been shutdown.


## IMPORTANT!

When you will connect to Let's Shop! server, ALL of your downloaded software from the official Nintendo eShop servers is going to be hidden. To show them again, use [faketik](https://github.com/ihaveamac/faketik/releases/latest/).

Put the .3dsx file inside the "3ds" folder inside your hacked 3DS SD card, then boot your 3DS with the SD card inserted, launch Homebrew Launcher, and launch "faketik".

**Please also be aware that we received bug reports where USA models could not download any applications.**
