# Let's Shop!

**WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE WUP (Wii U) eSHOP.**

Let's Shop is a collaborative effort to create custom backends for the Nintendo eShop (3DS only currently) in Python, before its death in March 2023.

## Info

This project is a rewrite in Python from the ReShop project, available <a href="https://github.com/ReShop-3ds">here</a>.

The finished beta 1.1 server is available here: https://github.com/LetsShop3DS/shopdeck

The custom server features all of the necessary servers to be Nintendo eShop-independant, meaning that the server will more or less stay the same after March 31, 2023.

Private beta will open soon!

Hope you enjoy our work! :sparkles: And if you do, don't hesitate joining our Discord: https://discord.com/invite/WHrpZvVgdK

# ABOUT PIRACY

Let's Shop official server WILL NOT IN ANY WAY OFFER FREE GAMES OR PROMOTE PIRACY. WE ARE AGAINST IT AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS PROJECT FOR THIS, AS YOU MAY GET IN SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH Nintendo.
