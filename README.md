Let's Shop is a collaborative effort to create custom backends for the Nintendo eShop (3DS only currently) in Python, before it's death in March 2023.

## Info

This project is a rewrite in Python from the ReShop project, available <a href="https://github.com/ReShop-3ds">here</a>.

It will feature a majority of eShop's servers (except the account server) such as title CDN, Ninja server, and all sorts of SOAP servers, to be able to be offcial eShop-free.

There is also title installation planned, because I think everybody agrees that just browsing an online shop without downloading anything is a bit... sad.

All of that... in 5 months, as I write this (3rd of November of 2022).*

Stay tuned! :sparkles:

# ABOUT PIRACY

Let's Shop official server WILL NOT IN ANY WAY OFFER FREE GAMES OR PROMOTE PIRACY. WE ARE AGAINST IT AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS PROJECT FOR THIS, AS YOU MAY GET IN SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH Nintendo.
